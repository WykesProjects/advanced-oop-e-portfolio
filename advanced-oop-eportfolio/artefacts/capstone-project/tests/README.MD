This package contains automated tests for the capstone project and supports a test-driven and verification-focused development approach.

The tests validate the behaviour of individual components as well as their interactions, ensuring that changes can be made safely without introducing regressions.

Key responsibilities of this package include:
    •	Verifying correct behaviour of domain models
    •	Testing audit logging and alert generation
    •	Validating security rule evaluation logic

Maintaining a dedicated test suite reinforces code reliability and demonstrates adherence to professional software engineering practices.
