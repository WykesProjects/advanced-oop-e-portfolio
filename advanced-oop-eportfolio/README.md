# Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming – e-Portfolio

This repository contains my e-Portfolio for the Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming module.

The e-Portfolio presents a curated collection of artefacts developed throughout the module, demonstrating my understanding and application of advanced object-oriented principles, secure coding practices, design patterns, and scalable software architecture. Collectively, these artefacts form a capstone-style body of work reflecting my learning journey across the module.

The primary summative artefact for this module is the **capstone project**, located within the `artefacts/capstone-project` directory. This project integrates concepts explored throughout the module and serves as the main evidence supporting the reflective evaluation submitted for assessment.

## Portfolio Structure

### `artefacts/`
- **Coding exercises** demonstrating advanced object-oriented programming principles, refactoring, and secure design.
- **Case studies** exploring software architecture, security considerations, and system scalability.
- **Capstone project artefacts** illustrating architectural decision-making, modular design, testing, and extensibility.

### `reflections/`
- Reflective commentary linking practical artefacts to module learning outcomes.
- Capstone overview and design rationale.

Each artefact includes a brief description outlining its purpose, the object-oriented principles applied, challenges encountered, and how it demonstrates advanced object-oriented design and programming concepts.

For assessors, the recommended starting point is the **capstone project**, followed by the reflective evaluation document, with supporting artefacts referenced throughout.
